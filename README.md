# Heart Disease Prediction Machine Learning Project

## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning methods to predict heart disease and compares the performance of multiple classic machine learning models. The data comes from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shantanugarg274/heart-prediction-dataset-quantum/data on kaggle. It is the final assignment 1 of my master's AI and Machine Learning course.

## Dataset
- `Heart Prediction Quantum Dataset.csv`: A heart disease prediction dataset with 500 records and 7 features.

## File Description
- `AI_And_MachineLearning_FinalTask02.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with complete data analysis and model implementation code.
- `AI_And_MachineLearning_FinalTask02.pdf`: PDF version of the project report.

## Implemented Models
- L1 Regression (Lasso)
- L2 Regression (Ridge)
- Polynomial Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes

## Results
L1 Regression performs best in terms of AUC-ROC metric (0.981), while Decision Tree performs best in terms of accuracy and precision (92.7% accuracy and 96.5% precision).
